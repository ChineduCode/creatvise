# **HTML5 Canvas Applications with TypeScript**

This repository contains two interactive canvas-based applications built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. These applications demonstrate shape drawing, customization, and editing capabilities using the HTML5 Canvas API.

---

## **Assignment 1: Border-Radius Feature in Shapes**

### **Objective**

Create a canvas-based application where users can:

- Draw shapes (rectangles and circles).
- Dynamically adjust the **border-radius** of the shapes.
- Customize the **color** and **stroke**.
- Save the canvas as an image.

### **Features**

- **Shape Selection**: Toggle between rectangles and circles.
- **Dynamic Border-Radius**: Modify the border-radius in real time using sliders or inputs.
- **Customization**: Set the shape's color and stroke width.
- **Save Canvas**: Download the canvas as an image.

### **Getting Started**

#### Install dependencies

- **npm install**

### Start the development server

- **npm run dev**

### Open the application

-**Visit <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.**

### Usage

- Select a shape type (Rectangle or Circle).
- Adjust the border-radius, color, and stroke width using the controls.
- Click Save Canvas to export the canvas as an image.

## **Assignment 2: Custom Path Editing in Shapes**

### Objective

Create a canvas-based application where users can:

- Draw shapes (rectangles and polygons).
- Edit the shape paths interactively by dragging vertices.
- Snap vertices to a grid for precise alignment.

### Features

- **Shape Drawing**: Draw rectangles and polygons on the canvas.
- **Path Editing**: Drag vertices to modify shapes dynamically.
- **Grid Snapping**: Enable snapping for better alignment.
- **Real-time Updates**: Visual changes happen instantly during interaction.

### Getting Started

Clone the repository:

- git clone <https://github.com/chineducode/creatvise.git>
  cd creatvise

### Install dependencies

npm install
Start the development server:

- npm run dev
- Open the application:
- Visit <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.

### Usage

- Select Add Rectangle or Add Polygon to draw shapes.
- Drag vertices to modify shape dimensions.
- Enable Grid Snapping for precise adjustments.

### Project Structure

- The codebase is organized as follows:

src/app: Core component for rendering the canvas and handling interactions.
src/app/page.tsx: Entry point for the application, rendering the canvas and controls.
src/app/first-assignment: First assignment page
src/app/second-assignment: Second assignment page
src/app/globals.css: Global styles for the application.

### Technologies Used

Next.js: Framework for server-side rendering and modern web development.
TypeScript: Adds type safety to JavaScript.
HTML5 Canvas API: Provides drawing capabilities for shapes and paths.
TailwindCSS: For styling
